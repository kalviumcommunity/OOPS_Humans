## Project on Personification and Emotional Interactions



In this project, we utilize personification to
give emotions human-like characteristics.
By doing so, we can better understand
how emotions interact with each other
and influence decisions. This technique
allows for a more immersive experience in
emotional simulations and enhances user
engagement.

Polymorphism for reactions of individuals

Inheritance for inheriting actions

Abstraction for what we say

Encapsulation for internal thoughts.




Emotional interactions form the core of
our project. We analyze how different
emotions can affect behavior and
decision-making. By modeling these
interactions, we can simulate complex
scenarios that reflect real-life emotional
dynamics, providing valuable insights into
human psychology.
